Prodigy_ML_04

🎯 Completed: Machine Learning Internship Task 04
📌 Topic: Hand Gesture Recognition Model
🏢 Internship: Prodigy InfoTech

🖐 In this project, I developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify hand gestures using the LeapGestRecog dataset (30,000+ gesture images).

🔍 This task helped me:
✔️ Gain hands-on experience in image preprocessing (resizing, grayscale conversion, normalization)
✔️ Train CNNs for gesture classification with >99% accuracy
✔️ Visualize predictions, learning curves, and confusion matrix
✔️ Understand real-world applications in sign language translation, AR/VR, and touchless control systems

📊 Model Achievements:

Training Accuracy: ~99%
Validation Accuracy: ~99%
Clear classification results visualized using matplotlib & confusion matrix
